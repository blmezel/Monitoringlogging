# Prompts for gemini-pro
I need a technical analysis for a Linux Service Manager Wrapper project.

Please research and provide:
1. **5 Language Comparison:** Compare Bash, Python, Go, Node.js, and Rust based on "Concurrency" and "I/O Performance" for a system monitoring tool.
2. **Unix I/O Architecture:** Explain how to handle File Descriptors (0/1/2), TTY vs Pipes, and Standard Streams (stdout/stderr) in this context.
3. **Recommendation:** Choose the best language for a "SecOps" focused wrapper that needs to be JSON-First and automation-friendly.
